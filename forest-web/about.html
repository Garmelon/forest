            <h1>Forest</h1>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Forest is a project based around interacting with trees of
                plain-text nodes. It has an API that is intentionally kept
                simple. Writing your own clients or bots is explicitly
                encouraged!
            </p>
            <p>
                At the moment, there are a server and a terminal-based client
                written in haskell, and the web-based client you're using right
                now, made with (vanilla) javascript. The web-based client is
                heavily based on the terminal-based client, both in look and
                behaviour. The color scheme is just my terminal's current color
                scheme.
            </p>

            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <h3>Controls</h3>
            <pre>
tab           - fold/unfold current node
arrow keys/jk - move cursor
            </pre>
            <h3>Permissions</h3>
            <p>
                A node's permissions are displayed at the right side of the
                screen, like this:
                <span style="color: var(--bright-black);">(edra)</span>.
                If a permission is set, its character is displayed. Otherwise, a
                dash is displayed in its place. Only when a permission is set
                can its action be performed.
            </p>
            <pre>
e (edit)   - edit a node's text
d (delete) - delete a node
r (reply)  - reply to a node
a (act)    - perform a node-specific action
            </pre>
            <h3>Colors</h3>
            <p>
                The cursor position is marked by a
                <span style="background-color: var(--blue);">blue background</span>.
                If a node is colored
                <span style="color: var(--yellow); font-weight: bold;">yellow</span>,
                it has child nodes.
            </p>
